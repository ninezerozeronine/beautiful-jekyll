This is the source for http://www.ninezerozeronine.com

The template comes from [Dean Attali's Beautiful Jekyll project](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll). The original readme for that can be found here: https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme

Here are the modifications I've made on top of his original template (Other than very basic changes in the `_cofig.yml` file):

## Add link to tags and search

* Just make an entry in the navbar links in `_config.yml`
